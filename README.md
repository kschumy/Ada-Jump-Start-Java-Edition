# Ada Jump Start (Java Edition)
Java Programs for Ada Developer Academy - Jump Start Assignments 

## About
These programs are based on the assigments for [Ada Developers Academy Jump Start program](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start). While the assignments were intended for Ruby, the programs here are in Java. Each one has some slighly changes elements from the original directions.

## Programs
All directions are to the Ada Developers Academy Jump Start program assigment the program is based on. Modifications are the changes I made to the original direction. Not that there was anything wrong with the original directions! I just added some elements I thought would be fun.
